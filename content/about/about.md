Welcome to the *iScsc* blog!

## The iScsc
First of all, iScsc stands for **ISAE SupAero Computer Science Club**.  
As this title suggests, we're an ISAE SupAero's (an Engineering School from Toulouse, France) club which focuses on Computer Science.

The club was first founded in 2021 and aims to gather students around a common passion or interest.  
It is more or less split into two main subjects:
 - **Development**: we have interest for all programming language, how they work, their pros and cons, and develop together various applications and systems, useful as well as useless one. The point is always to learn and have fun!
 - **Cybersecurity**: we learn about hacking what is it and why is it important, how things and systems work inside and how to exploit them *(Disclaimer: of course with an educational purpose and respecting ethics and laws)*, and play CTF together

and of course every member can be part of both as they wish!

Two other smaller fields, but which are often included in the first two, are Linux and system administration.
